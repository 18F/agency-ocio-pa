# Team Process

## Standup

We conduct our standups daily over Google Meet. Our practice is walk our Kanban board from right to left, starting with the Accepting column. Our goal is to keep moving work closer to Done, and to identify and eliminate blockers.

Work and concerns that are not on the board should be noted for further discussion after the Kanban board walk is complete.
